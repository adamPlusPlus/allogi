# Allog Server Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancements to the Allog Intermediary Server, including structured error handling, metrics collection, health monitoring, and enhanced logging systems.

## ðŸš€ New Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`error-handler.js`)
- **Structured Error Responses**: Detailed error objects with unique IDs, categories, and context
- **Error Categorization**: Automatic classification into 13 categories (validation, authentication, database, etc.)
- **Contextual Information**: Endpoint, method, sourceId, userAgent, IP address tracking
- **Helpful Suggestions**: Actionable advice for error resolution based on error type
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic identification of retryable vs. non-retryable errors
- **Structured Logging**: All errors logged as structured logs for viewer consumption

**Error Categories:**
- `validation` - Input validation failures
- `authentication` - Credential/access issues
- `authorization` - Permission problems
- `rate_limit` - Rate limiting exceeded
- `database` - Database connection/query issues
- `network` - Network connectivity problems
- `file_system` - File I/O operations
- `configuration` - Server configuration issues
- `timeout` - Request/operation timeouts
- `not_found` - Resource not found
- `conflict` - Resource conflicts
- `service_unavailable` - Service unavailability
- `general` - Unclassified errors

### 2. Metrics Collection (`metrics-collector.js`)
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, network, uptime monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Request counts, response times, percentiles
- **Database Metrics**: Connection status, operation counts, storage usage
- **WebSocket Metrics**: Connection counts, active vs. stale connections
- **Custom Metrics**: Extensible metric collection system
- **Real-time Collection**: Automatic metrics gathering at configurable intervals

**Metrics Collected:**
- System: CPU load, memory usage, network interfaces, uptime
- Performance: Request rates, response times (p50, p90, p95, p99), endpoint usage
- Database: Connection status, storage usage, operation performance
- WebSocket: Connection counts, health status
- Errors: Error rates, error types, error history

### 3. Health Monitoring (`health-checker.js`)
- **Component Health Checks**: Individual monitoring of server components
- **Automatic Health Assessment**: Scheduled health checks with configurable intervals
- **Health Status Classification**: Healthy, Warning, Critical, Error states
- **Detailed Health Reports**: Component-specific health information and diagnostics
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early detection of potential issues

**Health Checks Implemented:**
- `database` - Database connectivity and responsiveness

- `memory` - Memory usage monitoring and thresholds
- `websocket` - WebSocket connection health
- `rate_limiting` - Rate limiting system status
- `log_rotation` - Log rotation schedule compliance
- `archives` - Archive system health and storage

### 4. Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Health Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Overall system health status
- `GET /health/:component` - Component-specific health information

#### Metrics Endpoints
- `GET /metrics` - Comprehensive system metrics
- `GET /metrics/errors` - Error statistics and history

### 5. Structured Logging Integration
- **Server Lifecycle Logging**: Startup and shutdown events logged as structured logs
- **Request Tracking**: All API requests logged with timing and context
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for viewer consumption
- **Metrics Logging**: System metrics automatically logged as structured logs
- **Health Check Logging**: Health check results logged for monitoring

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for error handling, metrics, and health checking
- **Dependency Injection**: All modules receive server instance for access to shared resources
- **Event-Driven**: Metrics collection and health checking run on configurable intervals
- **Non-Blocking**: All monitoring operations are asynchronous and non-blocking

### Integration Points
- **Error Handler**: Integrated into all API endpoints for consistent error responses
- **Metrics Collector**: Automatically tracks all HTTP requests and system metrics
- **Health Checker**: Monitors all major server components independently
- **Structured Logging**: All systems log to the main server log system for viewer consumption

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Support for environment-based configuration overrides
- **Flexible Intervals**: Configurable collection and check intervals
- **Thresholds**: Configurable health thresholds and warning levels
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new health checks and metrics

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Live Health Status**: Current health of all components
- **Performance Metrics**: Request rates, response times, resource usage
- **Error Tracking**: Error rates, types, and trends over time
